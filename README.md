## Node/express backend with react frontend
The app is called devconnector, following the "MERN stack front to back" videos from udemy.

## What I hope to learn by the end of this
This will teach me how to make an api with node/express on the backend and have react display that data on the front end. I will learn things like, authenticating a user, adding a new user to the database and user sessions.

## Technologies used
React  
Node.js  
Express
